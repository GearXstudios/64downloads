 ## F.A.Q.
  These are constantly asked questions by our members, users, and buyers.
 
 # Can I run these games on my PC? 
  Technically, yes. But, with a machine like a GearX 64 and your USB, it allows you to play with Serial and Parallel port gamepads and joysticks like the Gravis PC Gamepad or and Atari Joystick! Although for a classic experience, we recommend using a wireless keyboard and mouse; a Logitech K330.
