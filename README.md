# F.A.Q.
  These are constantly asked questions by our members, users, and buyers.
 
## Can I run these games on my PC? 
  Technically, yes. But, with a machine like a GearX 64 and your USB, it allows you to play with Serial and Parallel port gamepads and joysticks like the Gravis PC Gamepad or and Atari Joystick! Although for a classic experience, we recommend using a wireless keyboard and mouse; a Logitech K330. To give labor consideration, with your modern PC you would have to use an emulator like DOSBox to play them; to use that you have knowledge in programming and some DOS commands (*Note that DOSBox uses MS-DOS 5.0 which is not compatible with MS-DOS 6.22 Programs that are also compatible with Windows 3.0 and above). 
  
 On a GearX 64 machine you will have no problem running these games. As long as your USB accepts your RAM as 16 MB, you can play even the oldest games for MS-DOS and FreeDOS! Plus we give you a USB that comes with our advanced MS-DOS / FreeDOS compatible GUI we call Skyline OS.
 
## Can't you find these shareware games all over the internet?
 Sure you can, but are all of the downloads from ALL OVER the web safe? We can garantee that our games are. Plus, what if you want the full versions of these games on the internet? Some of them are very hard to find and may be unsafe. So why not skip the hard labor for yourself and on a side note know that we will only give you safe ZIP files and EXE files.
 
## Who started this organization?
 Me, my name is Nikolas Karinja. I started this in early 2017 with a passion for retro PC games. I had the idea and pushed it forward. Then my friends eventually joined in and we started a small organization called GearX Interactive.
